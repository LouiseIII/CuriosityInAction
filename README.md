# CuriosityInAction
This repository was created to go beyond my courses and experiment with various projects, allowing me to explore new paths and deepen my knowledge. It serves as a way to challenge myself while nurturing my curiosity. The projects here are inspired by multiple sources, including discussions, articles, and previous research.
