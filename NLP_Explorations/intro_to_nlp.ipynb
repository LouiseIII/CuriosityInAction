    "By leveraging the Hugging Face transformers library, we classify text data into positive or negative sentiments. This project introduces to the basics of working with pre-trained NLP models, including data preprocessing, model loading, and prediction evaluation. It is an excellent starting point for understanding how deep learning models can be applied to real-world text classification tasks with minimal setup."
